# Processing-Genome-Sequence-Experiment
In this expiriment, the Genome sequences of Human patients and rats were analyzed in order to compare their whole genome sequence. Several of the files were recived in a single strand per file, then the two strands had to be aligned useing Mixcrâ€” a software used to process information in Bioinformatics. 
After several attempts to process the sequences through mixcr to analyze TCRs in the human genomes, it was found that the seqeunces did not have enough information to analyze TCRs. 
The lack of TCRs has casued the expiriment to pivot to whole genomes analysis.
